- using react typescript.
- using some css transition with framer-motion and styling css with style internal atribute react, I am usually to using style attribute with react.js and in react-native for speeds up development, although not recommended. 
- using hooks context for state management.
- using netlify deploy manually.
- some ux with keyboard event, error handle, content loading, transitions, internal react attribute and state management.
- search users in 5 username using request max per_page=100 user data and find using somes array method with same lowecase login name and limiting by 5 user github list in userContext getListUser.
- display repository with no limit repository that mean divide the amount of public repo by max 100 amount so I made a list of urls to call and the number of repositories combined in userContext getDetailRepoMultiple method
