3. using hooks context for state management.
4. using netlify for deploy manually.
5. some ux with keyboard event, error handle, loading with library, internal react attribute and state management.
6. search users in 5 username using request max per_page=100 user data and find using somes array method, with same lowecase login name and limiting by 5 user github list in userContext line 31.
7. display repository with no limit repository that mean divide the amount of public repo by max 100 amount so I made a list of urls to call and the number of repositories combined in getDetailRepoMultiple method
